error_message,explanation,solution
ValueError: shapes (x, y) not aligned,This error occurs when trying to perform matrix multiplication with arrays that do not have compatible dimensions.,Ensure the shapes of the matrices or tensors align correctly for the intended operation.
ValueError: Found input variables with inconsistent numbers of samples,This error occurs when the input arrays provided to a model or function have different numbers of samples (rows).,Verify that all input arrays (features, labels, etc.) have the same number of samples.
MemoryError: Unable to allocate x.xx GiB for an array with shape (x, y) and data type float64,This error happens when the system runs out of memory while trying to allocate space for an array.,Reduce the size of the dataset, use data batching, optimize memory usage by using smaller data types, or consider using more efficient data structures or algorithms.
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int',This error occurs when an operation involves a `NoneType` object, indicating that a variable has not been properly initialized or has been assigned `None`.,Ensure that all variables are properly initialized and assigned valid values before performing operations on them.
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'X',This error happens when trying to access an attribute or method that does not exist in the specified module or object.,Verify that the correct module or object is being used and that the attribute or method exists.
ImportError: No module named 'X',This error occurs when a specified module cannot be found.,Ensure that the module is installed and that the correct environment or virtual environment is active.
ConvergenceWarning: Maximum number of iterations reached before convergence,This warning indicates that a model's optimization algorithm did not converge within the maximum number of iterations.,Increase the number of iterations allowed for the algorithm, adjust the learning rate or other hyperparameters, and ensure the data is properly scaled and normalized.
DataConversionWarning: A column-vector y was passed when a 1d array was expected,This warning occurs when a model expects a 1D array for the target variable but receives a 2D array instead.,Reshape the target variable to a 1D array using `ravel()` or `flatten()` methods, and check the shape of the target variable before passing it to the model.
NotFittedError: This X instance is not fitted yet. Call 'fit' with appropriate arguments before using this estimator,This error occurs when trying to use a scikit-learn estimator before it has been fitted with data.,Ensure that the `fit` method has been called on the estimator with the training data and check the sequence of operations to ensure the model is properly trained before use.
KeyError: 'X',This error happens when trying to access a key that does not exist in a dictionary or DataFrame.,Verify that the key exists in the dictionary or DataFrame, check for typos or mismatches in key names, and use methods like `get` for dictionaries or `loc` with error handling for DataFrames.
